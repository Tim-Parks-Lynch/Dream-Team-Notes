# Algorithms and Problem Solving
## Intro to Problem Solving

**How to improve your problem solving skills?**

1. Devise a plan for solving problems
2. Master common problem solving patterns



## Problem Solving

**1. Understand the problem**

- Answer these questions

  1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
  2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
  3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  4. Can you get the outputs that are expected just using that information? Do I have enough information to solve the problem?
  5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?



**2. Explore Concrete examples**

- Start with simple examples
- Progress to complex examples
- Edge cases: empty/invalid inputs


**3. Break it down**

- Explicitly write out the steps you need to take


**4. Solve/simplify**

- Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
- Temporarily ignore that difficulty
- Write a simplified solution
- Then incorporate that difficulty


**5. Look back and refactor**

- Talk it out loud
- Answer these questions:
  1. Can you check the result?
  2. Can you derive the result differently?
  3. Can you understand it at a glance?
  4. Can you use the result or method for some other problems?
  5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
  6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
  7. How have other people solved this problem?
